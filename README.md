# Wildfire_Risk_Predictor
This project predicts the probability of a wildfire occurring based on key environmental factors like temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, vegetation type, elevation, and NDVI. It uses a machine learning model trained on wildfire data to help monitor and assess wildfire risk in real-time.
